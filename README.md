# 🧠 PedAnalyze‑Web: Web-Based Pedestrian Behavior Annotation Tool
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)

**PedAnalyze-Web** is a web-based interface for the PedAnalyze tool, designed to streamline the annotation and analysis of pedestrian behavior in dash-cam videos. It is built to support autonomous vehicle research. It enables researchers, developers, and data scientists to create structured datasets with pre-defined tags for pedestrian and vehicle interactions, capturing critical scenarios like accidents or near-misses. With support for single-frame and multi-frame annotations, PedAnalyze-Web reduces redundancy and enhances temporal relationship analysis, making it a valuable tool for advancing safer autonomous driving systems.

> This project complements the [PedAnalyze](https://github.com/AugmentedDesignLab/ped-behavior-annotator) system, enabling researchers, traffic analysts, and AV developers to create high-quality behavior datasets for intelligent systems.

## 📸 Key Features

- 🎥 **Video Integration**: Load videos from local files or YouTube URLs.
- ⏱ **Precise Frame Control**: Use a slider and timestamp input for frame-level accuracy.
- 🏷 **Behavioral Tagging**: Add structured tags for pedestrians, vehicles, and environmental context.
- 📓 **Custom Notes**: Add rich descriptions or scene observations.
- 💾 **JSON Export**: Save annotations in a clean JSON format, ready for modeling or evaluation.
- 🌐 **Web-First UI**: Built with React for smooth interaction and low-latency annotation sessions.
